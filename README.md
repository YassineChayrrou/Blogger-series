# Blogger-series
simple blogger web applications with multiple technologies

## what is this about?
I thought in order to learn a new technologies what is better then creating things, a blog is very basic yet good project to get on track with whatever i want to learn, from using basic html/css/js for frontend to using some frameworks such as react, vue, angular... or just code a backend to learn new frameworks or languages be it nodejs, python flask, django, fastapi... or even php... really don't know!!
Anyways **blogger-series** is a simple repo where i make different blog web apps with various technologies.
